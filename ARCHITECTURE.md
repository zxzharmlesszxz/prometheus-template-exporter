# Architecture

## Overview

`prometheus-exporter-framework` is a reusable exporter shell.

It intentionally does not know about any business domain such as Debian packages, Puppet agent files, or Puppetfile parsing.
Domain logic is supplied by external `exporter.Feature` implementations.

## Package Layout

- `cmd`
  Minimal binary that runs the shell without domain features.
- `exporter`
  Public framework package used by concrete exporters.
- `exporter/featurekit`
  Typed generated-feature lifecycle helpers used by scaffolded exporters.

## Data Flow

1. A concrete exporter calls `exporter.MainFromProject(features...)`, `exporter.MainForProject(projectName, description, features...)`, or `exporter.Main(exporter.Config{...})` when it needs explicit metadata overrides.
2. The framework registers common CLI flags and asks each feature to register its own flags.
3. After parsing, the framework creates the logger, runtime options, and Prometheus registry.
4. The registry always receives:
   - `*_build_info`
   - Go runtime collectors
   - process collectors
5. Each feature registers its own collectors directly or wraps domain collection in `SnapshotCollector`.
6. The HTTP server exposes the registry on the configured telemetry path.

## Extension Contract

Features implement:

```go
type Feature interface {
	RegisterFlags(app *kingpin.Application)
	RegisterCollectors(ctx FeatureContext, registry *prometheus.Registry) error
}
```

Optional interfaces:

- `NamedFeature`
  Adds a feature name to structured logs and registration errors.
- `RuntimeConfigReporter`
  Adds feature-specific fields to the startup runtime config log.
- `DefaultListenAddressProvider`
  Provides the feature's default `--web.listen-address` value.

The helper `CollectorFeature` can be used when a feature only needs callbacks instead of a dedicated type.
The helper `SnapshotCollector` can be used when a feature needs a typed snapshot cache, background refresh loop, and common collection health metrics.
The `exporter/featurekit` subpackage can be used by scaffolded exporters that want a typed feature spec instead of hand-written flag, runtime-config, collector-registration, and collector-startup boilerplate.
The package also exposes small value/lifecycle helpers (`BoolFloat`, `UnixTimestamp`, `FileMTimeSeconds`, `FileScrapeMetrics`, `NormalizeDuration`, and `RegisterAndStartCollectors`) plus the `exporter/exportertest` package for shared exporter test assertions.

## Common HTTP Semantics

- The configured telemetry path exposes the Prometheus registry.
- The default telemetry path is `/metrics`.
- `/` serves the exporter-toolkit landing page when the telemetry path is not `/`.
- When the telemetry path is `/`, `/` serves metrics and no landing page is registered.
- `/healthz` returns `200 OK` with `ok\n` while the process is serving requests.
- `/debug/pprof/*` is disabled unless `--web.enable-pprof` is set.
- The landing page links to metrics and health endpoints.

The telemetry path must be a literal URL path that starts with `/`.
It must not include whitespace, query strings, fragments, or Go `http.ServeMux` wildcards.
`/healthz` and `/debug/pprof/*` are reserved for built-in handlers and cannot be used as telemetry paths.

`/healthz` reflects process health only.
Domain-source health belongs in feature collectors.

## Public API Stability

The public extension surface is:

- `Main`, `MainFromProject`, `MainForProject`, `RunCLI`, and `RunCLIFromProject`
- `Config`, `ConfigFromProject`, and `ConfigForProject`
- `Options`, `Run`, `MustRun`, `NewServer`, and `NewServerChecked`
- `HandlerOptions`, `NewHandler`, and `NewHandlerChecked`
- `Feature`, `FeatureContext`, `CollectorFeature`, and `StartableCollector`
- `Snapshotter`, `SnapshotStatus`, `SnapshotCollectorOptions`, `SnapshotCollector`, and `DefaultSnapshotRefreshInterval`
- `BoolFloat`, `UnixTimestamp`, `FileMTimeSeconds`, `FileScrapeMetrics`, `Uint64Counter`, and `NormalizeDuration`
- `NamedFeature`, `RuntimeConfigReporter`, and `DefaultListenAddressProvider`
- `NewRegistry`, `RegisterCollectors`, and `RegisterAndStartCollectors`
- `ExporterNameFromProject` and `DescriptionFromProject`
- `HydrateVersionMetadata` and `ResolveVersionMetadata`

The `exporter/featurekit` subpackage is public support for generated exporters and exposes `FeatureSpec`, `Feature`, `SmokeSpec`, `SmokeContext`, `SnapshotCollectorOptions`, `ResolveSnapshotCollectorOptions`, and `NewSnapshotCollector`.

The `exporter/exportertest` subpackage is public test support for downstream exporters.

`NewHandler` is a lower-level constructor for embedding or focused tests.
Production entrypoints should prefer `RunCLI`, `Run`, or `NewServerChecked`, which apply option normalization and telemetry-path validation before constructing handlers.
`NewServer` keeps its original no-error signature and normalizes options, but callers that need explicit errors instead of `http.ServeMux` panics should use `NewHandlerChecked` or `NewServerChecked`.

Concrete exporters should treat unexported functions and types as internal implementation details.
Breaking changes to the exported extension surface should be released with a major version bump.

## Metric Ownership

The framework owns only common exporter metrics:

- `*_build_info`
- Go runtime metrics
- process metrics
- `*_last_collection_*` metrics when a feature opts into `SnapshotCollector`

Every business metric and domain diagnostic metric is owned by the concrete feature.
For example:

- Debian package metrics belong to the package feature.
- Puppet agent source-health metrics belong to the Puppet feature.
- Puppetfile module metrics belong to the Puppetfile feature.

## Failure Semantics

The framework fails startup when a feature cannot register its collectors.
Runtime scrape failures are domain-specific and should be represented by feature collectors.
When a feature uses `SnapshotCollector`, the framework stores the latest typed snapshot and emits common collection timestamps and success state from the feature-provided `SnapshotStatus`.

For example, a feature can:

- emit `*_up = 0`
- serve cached metrics after a failed refresh
- omit business metrics when its source is unreadable
- increment read or parse error counters

The framework does not impose one policy because the existing exporters use different failure semantics.
