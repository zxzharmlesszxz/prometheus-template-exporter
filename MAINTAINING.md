# Maintaining

This repository is a reusable exporter framework, not a product binary.
The main goal is to keep the framework safe for downstream exporters to import
and copy from.

## Local Checks

Run the standard maintenance check before changing the framework:

```bash
make check
```

`make check` runs formatting checks, `go vet`, `staticcheck`, coverage threshold
checks, binary smoke tests, and race tests.
CI also checks the external `prometheus-exporter-scaffold` repository by
rendering a demo exporter against the current framework checkout.

Concrete exporter scaffolding lives in the separate
`prometheus-exporter-scaffold` repository. The release workflow verifies the
scaffold against the current framework checkout before publishing a new module
tag, then opens a scaffold update pull request and creates the GitHub Release
only after that scaffold update succeeds.
If a module tag exists without a GitHub Release, rerun the workflow with the same
version to verify the tagged commit and retry the scaffold update plus release
publication.

When Docker is available, validate the runtime image separately:

```bash
make docker-smoke
```

Docker smoke is intentionally optional because not every development or CI
environment has a Docker daemon.

## Version Tags

Downstream exporters may pin this module with `go get ...@vX.Y.Z`, so semver
tags are still useful for module consumption.
Those tags do not imply publishing this repository's framework binary or Docker
image as an end-user release artifact.

Before tagging:

1. Run `make check`.
2. Optionally run `make docker-smoke`.
3. Review the public API list in `ARCHITECTURE.md` if exported symbols changed.
4. Tag with semver when downstream projects need a stable module version.

## Version Metadata

The Dockerfile and CI build validation pass linker values to
`github.com/prometheus/common/version`:

- `Version`
- `Branch`
- `Revision`
- `BuildUser`
- `BuildDate`

The binary smoke test verifies this metadata through `--version` and the
`*_build_info` metric. Concrete exporter repositories should own their own
publishing flow and release metadata policy.
